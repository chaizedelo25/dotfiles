# dotfiles
Updated dotfiles repo!

## Install Pre-Req's:

```
sudo apt install git

```

```
Have to use sudo bash .sh to run sh files
```
## Folder/Script Set Up:

- Each task has their own bash script to run.
- Each script there are the commands to make sure when run the information is avaliable to download. 

#Issues
- Different scripts might not run correctly because there a lot of different steps to try and follow for Mac.

- Going to go back and edit each script to fit each need correctly. The scripts now should be up to date but always a case of double checking.
